# python-challenge
This challenge reviews python methods to import csv files, create for loops to iterate through rows, calculate percentages of mixed variables, calculate differences of values month to month, print results, and write them into a file within a folder.
I used Chris Livesays code <https://github.com/Clivesay1/python-challenge.git> as a reference with permission to get me started, and was able to google a lot of the other material I wasn't familiar with, and I used references from previous work to better use some of the methods contained in my code.
